## Prerequisites

You will need a Roon audio subscription

### Hardware 
  - One of the displays listed above
  - a Raspberry Pi (I used a Pi 0 V1)
  
### Software
  - Dietpi (www.dietpi.com) I used V6 Bullseye (Raspian should work without any trouble).
  
Clone this repository (`https://github.com/jason-a69/roon_cad`)

`./setup.sh`

Play some music in the correct zone and your display should light up 

When you stop the music the display should turn off

Enjoy!
